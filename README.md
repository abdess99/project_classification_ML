# project_classification_ML
The objective of the project is to apply a machine learning model that is effective and compatible for two different datasets: the  Banknote Authentication and the  Chronic Kidney Disease datasets. In particular, the data is labelled in two categories so we will implement binary classification on it after a preliminary step of pre-processing.
The main tasks for this project are to: clean the data and pre-process it, building a model based on a decision tree and performing cross-validation on it and finally validating the results.

To use the algortihm, you must run main.py
